## Insider Threat Behaviour Scenarios - Patterns Injected for Testing 

**Low-and-Slow Exfiltration**  
Simulates an attacker slowly stealing data by slightly increasing file exports, external shares, and downloads at the same time to avoid loud alarms.

**Internal Reconnaissance**  
Mimics an attacker poking around in sensitive security logs or trying to change admin settings, which are rare events for normal users.

**Suspicious Login Pattern**  
Models a compromised account by combining several red flags: a few login failures, logging in at an unusual time, and coming from a new IP address.

**Data Staging**  
Represents an attacker gathering data into one place (unusual file uploads and moves) and then deleting the evidence.

**Policy Violation**  
Simulates a user trying to weaken security by doing things like disabling Two-Factor Authentication (TFA) or changing security policies.

**Data Hoarding**  
Models a disgruntled employee collecting internal files — not exfiltrating yet, but downloading and copying unusually large amounts of data.

**Subtle Off-Hours Work**  
A classic insider threat pattern where a user logs in after normal business hours and performs a single sensitive action, such as exporting files.

**Privilege Seeking**  
Represents a user trying to gain unauthorized access by attempting to change their role or escalate permissions.

**Cleanup Activity**  
Simulates an attacker attempting to cover their tracks by permanently deleting files, which is rare and highly suspicious.
